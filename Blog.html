<h3 class="big">So What Is Studio Winston?</h3>

<p>Founded by a 85 pound puppy, Studio Winston is a hub for our choose your own adventure story Dang David. </p>

<p>Without some wonderful people, this ambitious project would have never gotten past our imagination. Joey and Mathew are turning my disorganized writing into a cohesive story, my own brother Kevin has provided some wonderful music and photography, and Kurt has made much of the tech side even possible. </p>

<p>To learn more about them, I suggest going to our about page <a href="About.html" > here </a> to see who’s in charge of what aspects for Studio Winston.  While nothing has been finalized yet, Studio Winston has potential to become a hub for future projects if it seems logical. </p>

<h3>But What About This Book Thing?</h3>

 <p>Our book, titled Dang David, is a family friendly story where you are the main character. With nothing but your own wits, you must make decisions that can have lasting consequences.</p> 
 
 <p>After a chapter, one of your friends might have had a completely different experience than you do. To keep the narrative more personal, I have trusted Kurt to program what we call the “mad-lib machine.” </p>
 
 <p>At its core, it will allow players to rewrite certain aspects of the story such as the hero’s name, main weapon, horse, and even rename and change certain actions of characters.</p>
 

<h3>What’s the plot?</h3>

<p>After exploring your grandparent’s neighborhood goes awry, you and your brother are stuck in a strange world full of bizarre yet lovable creatures.  David is nowhere to be found on this world and it’s up to you to make sure you and David somehow find a way back home before dinner; otherwise you’re grounded the whole summer!</p> 

<p>In order to do this, you’ll need to trust the right people, solve treacherous puzzles, and make difficult decisions along the way.</p>

<p>This is the avatar that will be used when playing the game:</p>

<h3> I see. But what’s the goal of Studio Winston? </h3>

<p>At its core, Studio Winston is catered to those who enjoy family friendly content. Younger audiences will enjoy the characters, setting, and humor while not abandoning the older audience members as well.  Rather than using cheap potty humor for a laugh, we will work diligently to make sure an entire family can appreciate Studio Winston regardless of age. </p>

<h3>That being said, we also see Dang David as a great tool for education. </h3>

<center>	   <img src="images/Howard.png" title="Title"> </center>

<p>The main reason I was even inspired to create this stems from my love for reading. In grade school, I initially hated reading but after continuous practice, I eventually loved reading and through this project, want to share my love of reading with others who may still disdain literature. </p>

<p>Since The Dang David behaves as a book with video game like qualities, younger people will feel captivated as they explore alternate actions they didn’t choose the first time. Since readers will also input their own text into the game, it also provides readers a chance to learn vocabulary. For example, in the first chapter, the narrator asks to give him a noun, adjective, and adverb. If needed, the player can learn about these definitions then input a noun, adjective, and adverb into selected parts of the story. People can mess around with this and create the same kind of laughs that can only be found on a mad lib.</p>

<h3>Gotcha, when should we expect The Dang David to come out?</h3>

<p>As of now, we have no current date for The Dang David. That being said, we will post updates and sneak peaks on this blog as well as our twitter and instagram. We look forward to present more of Smif Adventures as more progress is made.</p>

<h3>What to expect on this blog?</h3>

<p>The primary goal of the Studio Winston blog is to provide updates on our book. Expect illustrations, sneak peaks, and other information will be posted here. </p>

<p>Thank you so much for your time. </p>

<p>If it was feasible, Winston would give each you a big lick as a token of appreciation. </p>
